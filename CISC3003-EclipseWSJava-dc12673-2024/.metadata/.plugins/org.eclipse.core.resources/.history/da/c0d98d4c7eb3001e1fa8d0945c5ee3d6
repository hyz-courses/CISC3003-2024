## How the java program works:

### 1. Welcome 1~4
No inputs are needed. These four programs just outputs ``Welcome to Java Programming!`` in different ways.

### 2. Addition
Takes an input of two integers and output their sum. Only integers are accepted. Sample inputs & outputs:

```console
Enter first integer: 10
Enter second integer: 20
Sum is 30
```

### 3. Comparison
Takes an input of two integers and output the result of the comparison, including ``>``, ``<``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``=``, and ``!=``. These conditions may overlap with each other. Only integers are accepted. Sample inputs & outputs:

```console
Enter first integer: 150
Enter second integer: 200
150 != 200
150 < 200
150 <= 200
```

### 4. Product
```console
Enter first integer: 10
Enter second integer: 15
Enter third integer: 20
Product is 3000
```
